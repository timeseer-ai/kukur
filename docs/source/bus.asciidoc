== Timeseer

Sources with `type = "timeseer"` configure Timeseer Bus sources.

```toml
[source.<name>]
type = "timeseer"
host = "<hostname or address of the Bus service>"
port = "<port of the Bus service>"
source = "<the remote source>"
api_key_name= "<the name of the api key>"
api_key= "<the api key>"
```

`source`, `api_key_name`, `api_key` are required fields.

`host` and `port` define the host and port where Timeseer Bus is running.

Defaults are:

```toml
host = "localhost"
port = 8081
```

The `source` points to the remote source that will be queried for data and metadata.
The name of the local and the remote sources do not need to match.

```toml
source = "test"
```

The `api_key_name` and `api_key` can be created in the timeseer application under `Configure > Global preferences > Api keys`.

```toml
api_key_name= "test"
api_key= "PcRU3xy0dsVpX8CeKCO1WPqPevECB9mZAETdWngK7druSl23JFA0Rw"
```

For example, this connects to the 'test' source on a local Timeseer Bus service:

```toml
[source.arrow]
type = "timeseer"
host = "localhost"
port = 8081
source = "test"
api_key_name= "test"
api_key= "PcRU3xy0dsVpX8CeKCO1WPqPevECB9mZAETdWngK7druSl23JFA0Rw"
```
