== Flight SQL

Connections to Flight SQL services can be configured using sources with type `flight-sql`.

```toml
[source.<name>]
type = "flight-sql"
connection_string = "" # required: connection string (usually grpc://...)
query_timeout_seconds = 0 # set to a specific number of seconds
username = "" # optional: configure a username
password = "" # optional: set the password for the username
verify_ssl = true # optional: set to false to disable certificate validation
```

All query options supported in the
ifdef::sources[]
<<ODBC, ODBC source>>
endif::sources[]
ifndef::sources[]
link:odbc.asciidoc[ODBC source]
endif::sources[]
are supported by the `flight-sql` source.

This example uses Flight SQL to connect to a https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-flight-sql-server[DataFusion Flight SQL Server] with a CSV and Parquet table added to its context:

```toml
[source.flight-sql]
type = "flight-sql"
connection_string = "grpc://localhost:50051"
list_query = "select distinct `series name` from tsai_antwerp_metadata"
data_query = """
select ts, value
from tsai_antwerp_data
where `series name` = $1
  and ts >= $2 and ts < $3
"""
```
