== JSON

Sources with `type = "json"` configure JSON sources.

JSON sources support reading metadata in the Kukur metadata format only.
This is useful when Kukur has been used to extract an offline data set.

```
[source.<name>]
metadata_type = "json"
metadata = "<path to directory with JSON files>"
```

`metadata` is required.
