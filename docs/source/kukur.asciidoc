== Kukur

Sources with `type = "kukur"` configure connections to other Kukur or Timeseer instances.

```toml
[source.<name>]
type = "kukur"
host = "<hostname or address of the other Kukur instance>"
port = "<port of the Kukur instance>"
source = "<the remote source>"
api_key_name= "<the name of the api key>"
api_key= "<the api key>"
```

`source` is a required field.
It points to the remote source that will be queried.
The name of the local and the remote sources do not need to match.

```toml
source = "test"
```

`host` and `port` define the host and port where Kukur is running.

Defaults are:

```toml
host = "localhost"
port = 8081
```

The `api_key_name` and `api_key` can be created in Kukur using the CLI or in Timeseer under `Configure > Global preferences > API keys`.

```toml
api_key_name= "test-key"
api_key= "PcRU3xy0dsVpX8CeKCO1WPqPevECB9mZAETdWngK7druSl23JFA0Rw"
```

Omit `api_key_name` and `api_key` when the `[flight]` configuration has `authentication = false`.

For example, this connects to the 'test' source on a local instance:

```toml
[source.arrow]
type = "kukur"
host = "localhost"
port = 8081
source = "test"
api_key_name= "test-key"
api_key= "PcRU3xy0dsVpX8CeKCO1WPqPevECB9mZAETdWngK7druSl23JFA0Rw"
```
